# COSYplatform Content Repository

Welcome to the **COSYplatform Content Repository**! This repository hosts all interactive curriculums, course roadmaps, teacher manuals, reference guides, student workbooks, and interactive lesson markup files used by the **CosyLanguages** teaching and learning platform.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT CONTENT SECURITY WARNING:**
> All files under `lessons/**/*.xml` and `lessons/**/*.json` committed to this public repository act as pre-publish content sources.
> Production interactive lesson materials (including teacher notes, speech scripts, and answer key overlays) are gated and served live from Supabase. Final lesson materials must be published to Supabase using the local founder script:
> ```bash
> node scripts/publish_to_supabase.js
> ```

## ✨ Key Features

- **Supabase Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RLS):** Private learning platform enforced by `shared/js/auth-guard.js`. Roles (`founder`, `teacher`, `student`) control access to courses and gated lesson content live from Supabase.
- **Dual Teacher & Student View Modes:** `teacher.html` renders yellow stage aim boxes, green speech scripts, hints, and visible answer key overlays; `student.html` filters out teacher notes to present a clean workspace.
- **Multi-Duration Pacing Filters:** `teacher.html` supports active slide duration filtering (`50m`, `80m`, `110m`) to tailor lesson pacing for short vs. extended sessions.
- **Classroom Projector Mode:** One-click full-screen projector view (`.projector-mode`) for classroom presentation.
- **Utility Drawers:** Instant sticky sidebar access to the COSYdata vocabulary dictionary lookup, irregular verb reference tables, and a configurable classroom timer.
- **Local Response Persistence:** Student inputs (`cosy-input`, `cosy-select`, `cosy-test`, `cosy-dnd-text`, `cosy-essay`) automatically persist state locally in browser `localStorage`.
- **Standalone Worksheet Print Styles:** `@media print` rules enable printing or exporting interactive lessons as offline PDF worksheets without loss of content.
- **Live Interactive Classroom (`classroom.html`):** Embedded Jitsi Meet WebRTC video calling, PeerJS peer-to-peer live state synchronization (slides, blanks, whiteboard drawing strokes, chat), Web Speech API audio vocabulary cards, interactive fill-in-the-blanks with instant verification, and collaborative canvas drawing practice.

## 📊 Language & Level Coverage Summary

Below is a summary of General curriculum level coverage across supported languages (pulled from [`docs/level-coverage-report.md`](docs/level-coverage-report.md)). Planned levels missing a curriculum JSON file are enumerated in `shared/js/auth-guard.js`'s `FULL_MANIFEST` with `"status": "not_yet_available"` to display "Coming soon" indicators in the UI.

| Language Code | Language | Available General Levels | Coming Soon Levels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `en` | English | `A1`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C1`, `C2` | `A0` |
| `fr` | French | `A1`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C1`, `C2` | `A0` |
| `ru` | Russian | `A1`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C1`, `C2` | `A0` |
| `de` | German | `A1`, `C1` | `A0`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C2` |
| `es` | Spanish | `A1`, `C1` | `A0`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C2` |
| `it` | Italian | `A1` | `A0`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C1`, `C2` |
| `el` | Greek | `A1` | `A0`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C1`, `C2` |
| `pt` | Portuguese | `A1`, `C1` | `A0`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C2` |
| `hy` | Armenian | `A1`, `C1` | `A0`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C2` |
| `ka` | Georgian | `A1`, `C1` | `A0`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C2` |
| `ba` | Bashkir | `A1`, `C1` | `A0`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C2` |
| `br` | Breton | `A1`, `C1` | `A0`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C2` |
| `tt` | Tatar | `A1`, `C1` | `A0`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C2` |

## 🛠 For Contributors

- **Single Canonical Curriculum Schema:** All course curriculums must be stored in the nested structure `curriculums/{iso}/{track}/{LEVEL}.json` and conform to `curriculums/_schema/curriculum.schema.json`. Legacy flat curriculum JSON files (`curriculums/_archive/legacy-flat/`) are archived and excluded from schema checks.
- **Roadmap-to-Lesson Linking Mechanism:** Sequence items in `roadmaps/*.json` link to lesson files via an explicit `"lessonFile"` property pointing to the relative file path under `lessons/` (e.g. `"lessonFile": "lessons/general-english-a1/nice-to-meet-you.json"`). Unmapped sequence entries are explicitly marked as `"status": "planned"`. Full resolution mappings are documented in `/docs/roadmap-lesson-resolution.json`.
- **Content Integrity Checks:** Automated CI checks run on every pull request (`node scripts/check-content-integrity.js` or `npm run check:integrity`) to prevent repository structural issues:
  1. **Duplicate Detection:** Ensures no two curriculum or roadmap files exist for the same language, track, and level combination. *To fix:* Consolidate or remove near-duplicate/duplicate files.
  2. **Sequence Entry Resolution:** Ensures every sequence item in `roadmaps/*.json` includes a valid `"lessonFile"` path or an explicit `"status": "planned"` marker. *To fix:* Add the `"lessonFile"` path or set `"status": "planned"`.
  3. **Manifest Active File Check:** Ensures every active course listed in `shared/js/auth-guard.js`'s `FULL_MANIFEST` has a corresponding roadmap or curriculum file on disk. *To fix:* Create the missing file or mark the manifest entry as `"status": "not_yet_available"`.
  4. **Orphan Curriculum Detection:** Ensures every curriculum file in `curriculums/{iso}/{track}/{LEVEL}.json` has a tracking entry in `FULL_MANIFEST`. *To fix:* Add the course entry to `FULL_MANIFEST` in `shared/js/auth-guard.js`.
- **Validation:** Always validate content integrity, curriculum schemas, and lesson schemas before committing changes:
  ```bash
  npm run validate
  ```
- **Publishing:** To push updated lesson materials to the live Supabase backend, run:
  ```bash
  node scripts/publish_to_supabase.js
  ```
