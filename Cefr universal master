## 0. How to read and use this file

### 0.1 Provenance tags
| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **[CoE-2001]** | Official Council of Europe wording (2001 framework), copied from the earlier project file. |
| **[CoE-aligned]** | Descriptor written in project wording, following the structure, scale names and level logic of the CEFR (2001) and the Companion Volume (CV, 2020). It is NOT a verbatim quote. Before public release, compare each scale with the official CV text (see section 10). |
| **[Gen]** | Pedagogical convention added by the project (task banks, decision rules, timings, topic lists). Not part of the CoE framework. |

### 0.2 Level codes
**There is no separate A0 level.** A0 is the starter part of the combined **A0–A1** band. The CEFR levels stored in data are `A1` · `A2` · `B1` · `B2` · `C1` · `C2`.

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `level` | `A1`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C1`, `C2` | Canonical CEFR level. The A0–A1 band is stored as `A1`. |
| `sublevel` | `null`, `start`, `p` | `start` = the A0 starter part of the A0–A1 band (alphabet, first words, rehearsed phrases; CEFR "Pre-A1"). `p` = plus level (`A2p`, `B1p`, `B2p`). |
| `band` (display/folder name only) | `A0-A1` | Label for the combined band, e.g. the folder `a0_a1`. Never store it as a `level` value. |

In this file the starter descriptors use the code **`A1s`** (A1, `sublevel: start`). Descriptors coded `A1` describe the core A1 level. Plus levels: `A2p`, `B1p`, `B2p` (see 1.3).

### 0.3 Descriptor IDs
Every descriptor has an implicit ID: **SCALE-LEVEL**, written **in lowercase in data**, e.g. `in-conv-b1`, `cmp-grm-a2`, `lis-ov-a1s`. Headings in this file use uppercase for readability only. In other repos, reference an ID as `cefr:in-conv-b1`. A missing level in a scale means the CEFR does not expect that ability at that level (or it is not yet described). Do not invent one.

### 0.4 Skills vs modes
- Classic 5 skills: Listening `LIS`, Reading `RD`, Spoken interaction `IN`, Spoken production `SP`, Writing `WR`.
- CV modes: Reception, Production, Interaction, **Mediation** (new in CV).
- In this file, scale codes: `LIS/AV/RD` = reception, `SP/WR` = production, `IN/WI/ON` = interaction, `MED` = mediation, `STR` = strategies, `CMP` = competences.
- For teacher records use 5 skills (section 7); mediation is recorded as an optional 6th column.

## 1. Levels

### 1.1 Groups and profiles
| Group | Level | Nickname | One-line profile |
|---|---|---|---|
| Basic user | **A1s** | Starter (the A0 part of the A0–A1 band; CEFR "Pre-A1") | Recognises and produces a few words and rehearsed phrases; alphabet, sounds, gestures and pictures do the work. |
| Basic user | **A1** | Breakthrough | Familiar words and formulae about self and immediate needs, slow clear speech, heavy reliance on the partner. |
| Basic user | **A2** | Waystage | Routine exchanges, simple description of background and environment, short past and future references; cannot sustain conversation alone. |
| Independent user | **B1** | Threshold | Copes independently with familiar and travel situations, narrates, gives brief reasons and opinions. |
| Independent user | **B2** | Vantage | Fluent, spontaneous, argues a viewpoint, handles abstract topics and technical talk in own field. |
| Proficient user | **C1** | Effective operational proficiency | Flexible, precise, implicit meaning, social/academic/professional use with little searching. |
| Proficient user | **C2** | Mastery | Effortless and nuanced; summarises and reconstructs arguments; distinguishes fine shades of meaning. |

French names for groups: *utilisateur élémentaire / indépendant / expérimenté*.

### 1.2 Global scale [CoE-2001]
- **C2** — Can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read. Can summarise information from different spoken and written sources, reconstructing arguments and accounts in a coherent presentation. Can express him/herself spontaneously, very fluently and precisely, differentiating finer shades of meaning even in more complex situations.
- **C1** — Can understand a wide range of demanding, longer texts, and recognise implicit meaning. Can express him/herself fluently and spontaneously without much obvious searching for expressions. Can use language flexibly and effectively for social, academic and professional purposes. Can produce clear, well-structured, detailed text on complex subjects, showing controlled use of organisational patterns, connectors and cohesive devices.
- **B2** — Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in his/her field of specialisation. Can interact with a degree of fluency and spontaneity that makes regular interaction with native speakers quite possible without strain for either party. Can produce clear, detailed text on a wide range of subjects and explain a viewpoint on a topical issue giving the advantages and disadvantages of various options.
- **B1** — Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc. Can deal with most situations likely to arise whilst travelling in an area where the language is spoken. Can produce simple connected text on topics which are familiar or of personal interest. Can describe experiences and events, dreams, hopes and ambitions and briefly give reasons and explanations for opinions and plans.
- **A2** — Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment). Can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar and routine matters. Can describe in simple terms aspects of his/her background, immediate environment and matters in areas of immediate need.
- **A1** — Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type. Can introduce him/herself and others and can ask and answer questions about personal details such as where he/she lives, people he/she knows and things he/she has. Can interact in a simple way provided the other person talks slowly and clearly and is prepared to help.
- **A1s** [CoE-aligned; corresponds to the CV's Pre-A1, stored as A1 with `sublevel: start`] — Can recognise a few very familiar words and short formulae (own name, greetings, numbers) and respond with gestures, single words or copied text, when the other person speaks very slowly, repeats and supports with pictures or gestures.

### 1.3 Plus levels [CoE-aligned + Gen]
`A2p`, `B1p`, `B2p` mark a **strong** level: the learner performs solidly at the level and regularly meets some (roughly half or more) descriptors of the next one, but not consistently enough for it. Use them for teacher records and course sub-steps, not for certificate claims. Add C1p only internally if needed.

### 1.4 Levels are cumulative and profiles are spiky
A level assumes everything below. Learners rarely have one level: reading usually runs ahead of listening, listening ahead of speaking, speaking ahead of accurate writing. **Always store a level per skill** and derive a single label only when needed (section 7.6).

## 2. The model behind the scales

### 2.1 Communicative language activities
| Mode | Activities | Scale codes |
|---|---|---|
| Reception | Listening (conversation, talks, announcements, media), audiovisual, reading (correspondence, orientation, information/argument, instructions, leisure) | `LIS-*`, `AV-*`, `RD-*` |
| Production | Spoken (monologue: experience, putting a case, announcements, addressing audiences), written (creative, reports/essays) | `SP-*`, `WR-*` |
| Interaction | Spoken (understanding, conversation, discussions, cooperation, transactions, information, interviews), written (correspondence, notes), online | `IN-*`, `WI-*`, `ON-*` |
| Mediation | Of texts (relay, summarise, note-take, respond to/analyse creative texts), of concepts (collaborate, lead, explain), of communication (bridge cultures, act as intermediary, defuse conflict) | `MED-*` |

### 2.2 Communicative language strategies
Planning, compensating, monitoring and repair, taking the floor, cooperating, asking for clarification: `STR-*`.

### 2.3 Communicative language competences
- **Linguistic:** range, vocabulary range/control, grammar, phonology, orthography: `CMP-RNG, CMP-VOC-R, CMP-VOC-C, CMP-GRM, CMP-PHO, CMP-ORT`.
- **Sociolinguistic:** `CMP-SOC`.
- **Pragmatic:** flexibility, thematic development, coherence/cohesion, propositional precision, fluency: `CMP-FLEX, CMP-THEM, CMP-COH, CMP-PREC, CMP-FLU`.
- **Plurilingual/pluricultural:** `CMP-PLURI`, `MED-COM-BRIDGE`.

### 2.4 Use domains (`use_domain`)
| `use_domain` | Typical settings |
|---|---|
| Personal | Home, family, friends, hobbies, personal correspondence, own online life |
| Public | Shops, services, transport, health, authorities, media, events |
| Occupational | Workplace, meetings, clients, professional documents |
| Educational | Classroom, study, lectures, exams, research |

Every session, lesson and task should be tagged with one `use_domain`. Do not confuse it with the repos' `domain` field, which means course track(s) (`general`, `spoken`, `exam` …).

---|---|
| Personal | Home, family, friends, hobbies, personal correspondence, own online life |
| Public | Shops, services, transport, health, authorities, media, events |
| Occupational | Workplace, meetings, clients, professional documents |
| Educational | Classroom, study, lectures, exams, research |

Every session, lesson and task in the platform should be tagged with one domain.

## 7. Teacher toolkit: verifying a student's level [Gen, built on the scales above]

### 7.1 Principles
1. Assess **each skill separately**: Listening, Reading, Spoken interaction, Spoken production, Writing (and Mediation optionally).
2. Use **at least two tasks per skill** and, where possible, two different days, because one performance can mislead.
3. Judge on **what the learner does without unplanned help**, not on what they recognise when helped.
4. Test the level **above** the suspected one. The learner's level is the highest level at which they perform consistently; failing the next one confirms the ceiling.
5. Record evidence (note, recording, text sample) with date, task and descriptor IDs.

### 7.2 Quick level indicators (speaking)
| Level | Pauses and hesitation | Sentence complexity | Errors | Vocabulary | Typical failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Very frequent, long | Isolated words, memorised chunks | Constant | Concrete basics | Cannot go beyond memorised set |
| A2 | Frequent, false starts | Simple sentences + "and/but/because" | Basic, systematic (tense, agreement) | Everyday, narrow | Cannot narrate or sustain talk |
| B1 | Noticeable in planning | Some subordination, simple past/future | Frequent but meaning clear | Enough with circumlocution | Struggles with abstract topics, complex tenses/moods |
| B2 | Few long pauses | Wide range of complex sentences | Occasional, rarely block meaning | Wide in general topics, some in field | Loses nuance, idiom, register control |
| C1 | Almost none | Flexible, varied, controlled | Rare | Broad, idiomatic | Slips in rare idiom or highly abstract subtlety |
| C2 | None | Natural, elegant | Almost none | Very broad, precise | (No practical limitation) |

### 7.3 Oral assessment criteria
Rate each criterion separately, using the descriptors in section 3.6:

| Criterion | Scale |
|---|---|
| Range | `CMP-RNG`, `CMP-VOC-R` |
| Accuracy | `CMP-GRM`, `CMP-VOC-C` |
| Fluency | `CMP-FLU` |
| Interaction | `IN-CONV`, `STR-TURN`, `STR-COOP`, `STR-CLAR` |
| Coherence | `CMP-COH`, `CMP-THEM` |
| Phonology | `CMP-PHO` |
| Sociolinguistic | `CMP-SOC` |

### 7.4 Written assessment criteria
| Criterion | Scale |
|---|---|
| Task achievement / content | `WR-OV`, `WR-CRE`, `WR-REP`, `WI-COR`, `WI-NOTE` |
| Range | `CMP-RNG`, `CMP-VOC-R` |
| Accuracy | `CMP-GRM`, `CMP-VOC-C`, `CMP-ORT` |
| Coherence and organisation | `CMP-COH`, `CMP-THEM` |
| Register and appropriacy | `CMP-SOC` |

### 7.5 Diagnostic task bank
Suggested tasks; each is scored against the scales named.

| Level | Spoken interaction | Monologue | Listening | Reading | Writing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A1s** | Greet, say name, point to and name 5 objects | Say name and count to ten | Follow 3 commands with gestures | Recognise own name, 5 signs | Copy name and 3 words |
| **A1** | Role-play: introduce yourself and order a coffee | Describe your family in 4 sentences | Short dialogue: catch time/price/name | Read a menu or notice; answer 3 questions | Fill a form; write a postcard (20–30 words) |
| **A2** | Role-play: buy a ticket / ask directions / invite a friend | Tell what you did last weekend and what you will do tomorrow | Short announcement or voicemail; extract 3 details | Read a timetable, ad or short letter; answer questions | Short informal email (40–60 words) about weekend or invitation |
| **B1** | Unprepared conversation about work/hobbies; solve a travel problem (lost luggage) | Narrate a memorable event or the plot of a film with reasons (1–2 min) | Radio item on familiar topic; identify main points and some details | Newspaper article or blog; main conclusions and details | Personal letter or story (100–150 words) describing experience and feelings |
| **B2** | Discussion of a topical issue (advantages/disadvantages); negotiate a solution | Prepared 3-min presentation; defend a viewpoint with examples | Lecture or interview; follow argument and speaker attitude | Longer article with a viewpoint; infer attitude, summarise | Essay or report (200–250 words) with argument for/against |
| **C1** | Abstract debate; role-play a delicate negotiation | 5-min structured talk on complex topic with Q&A | Unstructured discussion or documentary with implicit meaning | Long literary or specialist text; style and implication | Structured, formal essay/report (250–350 words), appropriate register |
| **C2** | Chair a debate; argue subtle positions with irony and allusion | Improvised persuasive speech; defend against hostile questions | Fast native speech, mixed accents, humour | Complex/abstract/literary text; critical evaluation | Synthesis of multiple sources into a polished article; review or critique |

### 7.6 Decision rules [Gen]
1. **Per-skill level:** the highest level at which the learner meets **most (about 70% or more)** of the sampled descriptors across tasks without unplanned help, and does **not** meet most of the next level.
2. **Plus:** meets most descriptors at level L and about half of level L+1 → `Lp` (A2p, B1p, B2p).
3. **Accuracy check:** if range or fluency is one level above accuracy, record the level from accuracy and add a note ("wide but inaccurate").
4. **Overall label (only if needed):** the level reached in at least **three of the four core skills** (listening, reading, speaking [interaction + production combined], writing), with no core skill more than **one level below**. Otherwise report the profile, not a single label.
5. **Re-test:** every 60–120 guided hours, or at end of a course level.
6. **Placement shortcut:** start at the suspected level, go up one level after success, down one after failure, stop when a level is passed and the next is failed.

### 7.7 Frequent misjudgement traps
- Reading and listening ahead of speaking: do not raise speaking level because of good reading.
- Recognition is not production: a learner may understand B1 texts but write A2.
- Familiar topics hide the B1 → B2 "abstraction wall": always test an abstract topic at B1+.
- Memorised chunks inflate A1–A2: use unprepared questions.
- Native-language transfer can make grammar look higher or lower than real (e.g. Romance-language speakers learning Italian/Spanish).
- Non-alphabetic or new-script languages: reading/writing may lag far behind speaking at A1s–A2.

### 7.8 Learner self-check ("I can", original wording) [CoE-aligned]
| | A1 | A2 | B1 | B2 | C1 | C2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| **Reading** | I understand names, words and simple sentences on signs and cards. | I read short simple texts and find specific information. | I read factual texts and personal letters about familiar topics. | I read articles with viewpoints and modern fiction. | I read long, complex texts and notice style. | I read virtually everything with ease. |
| **Spoken interaction** | I ask and answer simple questions if the person helps me. | I handle short routine exchanges. | I cope with most travel situations and join in conversation on familiar topics. | I speak with enough fluency to talk with native speakers regularly. | I express myself fluently and flexibly in social and professional life. | I take part effortlessly in any conversation and convey fine shades of meaning. |
| **Spoken production** | I use simple phrases to say where I live and who I know. | I describe my family, my daily life and my job in simple terms. | I tell stories, describe experiences and give reasons for opinions. | I give detailed presentations and explain a viewpoint. | I give clear, structured presentations on complex subjects. | I give smooth, well-organised speeches or arguments for any audience. |
| **Writing** | I write a postcard and fill in forms. | I write short notes and simple personal letters. | I write connected texts on familiar topics and personal letters. | I write detailed texts, essays and reports. | I write well-structured texts on complex subjects. | I write polished, stylistically appropriate texts of any kind. |

| **Script and sounds (A1s)** | Alphabet, letter-sound map, key pronunciation contrasts, stress/intonation basics |
| **Grammar milestones per level** | Which structures appear at which level (tenses, cases, moods, particles), ordered by the language's own logic |
| **Vocabulary lists per level and theme** | Use the theme tags from section 4 |
| **Phrases per function** | Use function tags from section 5 |
| **Typical learner errors** | By L1 background where known |
| **Register and culture notes** | Politeness, formal/informal, dialects |
| **Exams and certificates** | Only with source and `verified_date` |
| **Realistic top level and materials** | Especially for minority languages |
| **Adaptations to scales** | Script- or language-specific notes (e.g. `CMP-ORT` for non-Latin scripts, `CMP-PHO` for tonal/tense-vowel systems) |

### 8.1 Coverage status (snapshot of the repos, 2026-09-30)
| Language | Universal layer | Vocabulary entries (COSYdata) | General curriculum levels (COSYplatform) |
|---|---|---|---|
| English | full | 11,419 (A0–A1 to C2) | A1–C2 |
| French | full | 1,881 | A1–C2 |
| Russian | full | 1,721 | A1–C2 |
| Italian | full | 2,279 | A1 |
| Greek | full | 1,067 | A1 |
| German, Spanish, Portuguese | full | 492–510 | A1, C1 |
| Armenian, Georgian, Bashkir, Breton, Tatar | full | 393–414 | A1, C1 |
| Chuvash | full | 445 | none |

Store `coverage: full | partial | universal-only` per language and level, and show only what is verified.

### 8.2 Language-family notes affecting the scales [Gen, to be verified by experts]
- **Cyrillic-script languages (Russian, Tatar, Bashkir, Chuvash):** A1s includes alphabet and stress.
- **Greek, Armenian, Georgian:** own scripts; A1s = script and sounds.
- **Case-rich languages (Russian, Greek, Georgian, Armenian, German):** grammar accuracy (`CMP-GRM`) expectations rise with case mastery; teacher must decide which cases belong to which level.
- **Turkic languages (Tatar, Bashkir, Chuvash):** agglutinative morphology and vowel harmony affect `CMP-GRM` and `CMP-PHO`.
- **Breton:** mutations affect `CMP-GRM`; dialect choice affects `CMP-PHO`.
- **Armenian:** Eastern/Western decision; **Portuguese:** European/Brazilian decision.

## 9. Applying this file in the project repositories

### 9.1 Tags to use everywhere
`language` · `level` (A1–C2) · `sublevel` (`start` / `p` / null) · `skill` (lis, rd, in, sp, wr, med) · `scale` (e.g. `in-conv`) · `descriptor_ids[]` (e.g. `cefr:in-conv-b1`) · `theme_id` (t01–t22) · `function_ids[]` (section 5) · `use_domain` (personal / public / occupational / educational) · `source` · `verified_date`.

The repos' existing `domain` (course track), `theme` (lexical field) and `sub_theme` fields stay as they are.

### 9.2 Repo map
| Repo | Use |
|---|---|
| **cosyplatform** | **Canonical home of this file and its JSON version (`cefr/`).** Courses by language + level; lesson objectives = descriptor IDs; placement/diagnostic (7.5); student profile (7.9); access by language, course, level. |
| **cosydata** | Read-only mirror of the CEFR JSON. Vocabulary and phrase lists tagged by level, theme, function; existing `theme` fields unchanged. |
| **cosylanguages** | Level explainer pages, self-check ("I can" grid), practice filters by level/skill/theme, blog articles on levels; course-type catalog pages with level labels. |
| **cosytools** | Verbs, verbs + prepositions and grammar entries tagged by level of introduction; interactive practice filtered by level. |
| **cosymanuals** | Manual skeletons per language and level: chapters organised by theme, function and can-do; grammar sequence from the language layer. |
| **cosyevents** | Sessions tagged with level range, theme, use_domain, skill focus; converted into lessons with same tags; vocabulary duplicated to cosydata under correct level folder. |
| **cosygames** | Games tagged by level, skill, theme, function so teachers can filter (e.g. "B1 listening, travel"). |
| **cosyworld** | Not used; remove references. |

### 9.3 Suggested data model
```json
{
  "scale": {"id": "in-conv", "name": "Conversation", "mode": "interaction", "skill": "IN"},
  "descriptor": {
    "id": "in-conv-b1", "scale": "in-conv", "level": "B1", "sublevel": null, "use_domain": null,
    "text": "...", "source_tag": "CoE-aligned", "source_version": "2001/2020",
    "verified_date": null
  },
  "theme": {"id": "t08", "name": "Health and body", "levels": {"A1": "...", "A2": "..."}},
  "function": {"id": "f-advice", "levels": ["A2", "B1"]},
  "language_layer": {"language": "fr", "coverage": "partial",
    "grammar_milestones": [], "exams": [], "requirements": []}
}
```
Rules: `level` never holds `A0` or `A0-A1`; starter content is `level: A1` + `sublevel: start`. Events may use `level_from` / `level_to`. `verified_date` is mandatory for anything that can change (exams, requirements, hours); hide unverified items on public sites.

### 9.4 Versioning
Version this file (`1.0`, `1.1` …). Every repo stores the version of the CEFR master it was tagged against, so re-tagging can be done when the master changes.

## 10. Verification and open items (do before public release)

1. **Compare [CoE-aligned] wording with the official CV (2020) text** for each scale and replace with the official wording where the project wants canonical citations. This file follows the structure and logic, but the descriptors are the project's phrasing. Confirm the Council of Europe's reuse conditions for publishing descriptors.
2. **Plus-level descriptors per scale** are not written here; the CV has them (A2+, B1+, B2+). Add them from the official text if you want scale-level plus descriptors.
3. **A1s (starter) descriptors** here are project-written; the CV provides official Pre-A1 wording for some scales.
4. **Missing/partial scales:** some CV scales are not included or condensed (e.g. detailed mediation strategy scales, further online interaction, sign languages). Add if needed.
5. **Official translations** of descriptors exist for many languages; check availability for the project languages before writing UI translations.
6. **Themes (section 4) and functions (section 5)** are project conventions, not CoE; adjust with teachers.
7. **Timings, lengths, thresholds (70%, 1–2 min, etc.)** in sections 6–7 are conventions; calibrate with real student data.
8. Language layers for the 8 empty languages still need to be written.

## Appendix A: Official 2001 tables (to be carried over)

Paste here, unchanged, from the earlier reference file:
- **Table 2** — self-assessment grid (section 3 of the earlier file)
- **Table 3** — qualitative aspects of spoken language use (section 4 of the earlier file)

These are the [CoE-2001] canonical layers and should stay verbatim.

## Appendix B: Theme crosswalk (master themes ↔ repo fields) [Gen]

The repos' `theme` field (COSYdata) names lexical fields and word classes; the master's `theme_id` names communicative topics. Keep both.

| Master theme | COSYdata canonical theme(s) | Platform A1 module |
|---|---|---|
| t01 Identity | descriptors, communication, geography | 1 First contact & identity |
| t02 Family & relationships | family, emotions | 2 People & relationships |
| t03 Home | housing, objects | 3 Objects; 4 Home |
| t04 Daily routine & time | time, actions, activities, numbers | 4, 21 |
| t05 Food & drink | food | 5 |
| t06 Shopping & money | shopping | 6 |
| t07 Clothing | clothing, colors | 7 |
| t08 Health | health | 8 |
| t09 Weather, nature, animals | weather, nature, animals | 13 |
| t10 Travel & transport | travel | 11 |
| t11 Places & directions | navigation, geography | 12 |
| t12 Education | education | 9 |
| t13 Work | work | 9 |
| t14 Leisure | leisure, activities | 14 |
| t15 Media & technology | technology | 15 |
| t16 Culture & arts | none in the 30 (live data: culture) | 16 |
| t17 Society, politics, law | none (live data: politics, society, law) | 20 (basic) |
| t18 Economy & business | none (live data: business, economy) | 6 (basic) |
| t19 Environment | nature (live data: environment) | 13 |
| t20 Science & ideas | none (live data: science) | n/a |
| t21 Values & ethics | philosophy (live data: ethics) | n/a |
| t22 Language & communication | communication | 10, 20 |

Gap: t16–t21 have no canonical COSYdata theme yet.
